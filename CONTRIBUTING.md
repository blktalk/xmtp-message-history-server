## 🔀 Pull requests

PRs are encouraged, but consider starting with a feature request to temperature-check first. If the PR involves a major change to the protocol, the work should be fleshed out as an [XMTP Improvement Proposal](https://community.xmtp.org/t/xip-0-xip-purpose-process-guidelines/475) before work begins.

After a pull request is submitted, a single approval is required to merge it.
